# ME5406_project1
## Introduction
This is a coursework project of ME5406 (Deep Learning in Robotics) in NUS.<br>
The project aims to solve the `Frozen Lake Problem` which contains two tasks via model-free reinforcement learning approaches. 
The Frozen Lake problem considers a frozen lake as a grid-world scenario that a robot is to glide on the frozen surface from the top left corner to the bottom right corner in order to pick up a frisbee while avoiding falling into holes covered by patches of very thin ice.<br>
